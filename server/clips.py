"""The demo's premade clips, and the processor that plays one into the pipeline as the user's audio.

A clip goes in just after the transport's input, 20 ms at a time in real time, so everything after it (the
VAD, the STT, the perception reader) treats it exactly as it would a caller's voice. The same audio goes
out through the transport, so the visitor hears the clip too. The microphone isn't heard while a clip plays.
